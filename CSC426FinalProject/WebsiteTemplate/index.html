        <h1>Vehicle Emissions</h1>
        <h3>Exploratory Analysis of Vehicle Emissions Trends in the United States</h3>
        <p>
          During the post WWII boom in the US economy, and the affordability of individual transportation, Americans flocked to suburban bedroom communities. 
          This resulted in the average American worker commuting solo. By 2009, it is estimated that 81.5 percent of commuters from suburban areas made
          their daily drives alone, for an average of 25.1 minutes. <!-- source: https://alankandel.scienceblog.com/2013/06/15/fifty-years-of-american-commuting-1960-2009-what-the-numbers-say/-->
          Due to this, Americans are reported to have released approximately a cumulative 410.2 billion metric tons of CO2 into the atmosphere by 2019

          , along with other harmful motor vehicle emissions, such as NoX, PM, and lead from fuels. In order to combat this global plauge, the US Environmental Protection Agency, auto manufacturers, as well as consumer advocates, began to closely
          regulate, restrict, and monitor vehicle emissions beginning in the mid-1970's through sweeping amendments to the 1963 Clean Air Act.

      <h3>Fuel Economy in the United States by Manufacturer Origin</h3>
      <p>
        Historically, vehicles that were designed and manufactured domestically, have had larger engines than those produced abroad. Because of this, the US domestic market has lagged behind
        the import market in terms of emissions. As illustrated in this plot, although US domestic manufacturers are getting better fuel economy, imports have remained dominant in this area.
