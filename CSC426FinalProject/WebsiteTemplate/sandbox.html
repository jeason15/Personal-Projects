            During the post WWII boom in the US economy, and the affordability of individual transportation, Americans
            flocked to suburban bedroom communities.
            This resulted in the average American worker commuting solo. By 2009, it is estimated that 81.5 percent of
            commuters from suburban areas made
            their daily drives alone, for an average of 25.1 minutes.

            Due to this, Americans are reported to have released approximately a cumulative 410.2 billion metric tons
            of
            CO2 into the atmosphere by 2019

            , along with other harmful motor vehicle emissions, such as NoX, PM, and lead from fuels. In order to
            combat
            this global plauge, the US Environmental Protection Agency, auto manufacturers, as well as consumer
            advocates,
            began to closely
            regulate, restrict, and monitor vehicle emissions beginning in the mid-1970's through sweeping amendments
            to
            the 1963 Clean Air Act.
